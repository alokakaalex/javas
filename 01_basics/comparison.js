//simple comparisons
/*console.log(2>1);

console.log(2<1);

//complex comparisons
/*console.log("2">1); //they might give unexpected results
console.log("02">1); */ //hence it is advised to use sme datatypes for comparisons


/*console.log(null >0);// equality and comparisons operator works differently

console.log(null == 0); // comparison operator converts null to 0 and then compare
console.log(null>=0);*/

// strict check ===
//checks value as well as datatypes
